> This is a one-off to my blog. Not sure if I'll update again soon, but I wrote this post on social media and wanted to mirror it here. We'll see if in 2025 I start actively blogging again.

## My top ten albums of 2024 (in no particular order):

1. State Faults - Children of the Moon. Probably got the most play time out of anything in this list. Perfect blend of screamo, and melodic post-hardcore. 
 
 Favorite track: No Gospel  
 Bandcamp: https://statefaults.bandcamp.com/album/children-of-the-moon

2. Delta - Blue Garden. Math rock with a bit more indie twist.   
Favorite track: Glow  
Bandcamp: https://deltasleep.bandcamp.com/album/blue-garden-2

3. NO MAN - Glitter and Spit. The best hardcore band with the most important political message in our times. Also absolutely wonderful humans.  
Favorite track: March of Ides  
Bandcamp: https://shoverec.bandcamp.com/album/glitter-and-spit


4.  Toe - Now I see the Light. The Japanese math rock darlings are finally back.  
Favorite Track: WHO KNOWS?  
Bandcamp: https://toe-music.bandcamp.com/album/now-i-see-the-light

5. Alkaline Trio - Blood, Sweat, and Eyeballs. Always a soft spot for this band and the last recorded record with Derek Grant.  
Favorite track: Teenage Heart

6. Envy- Euonia. All their albums lately kind of sound similar, but I still can't get enough of it. Another banger.   
Favorite track: Whiteout  
Bandcamp: https://envy.bandcamp.com/album/eunoia

7. Flesh Tape - Gargoyle. Very biased here, since frontman Larson is my band mate and friend. I also had the honor of filling on bass for this band for a tour, so I ended up listening to this record a lot. This record deserves more love than I've seen. PS: PLAY SUNNY LIVE.  
Favorite track: "Sunny"  
Bandcamp: https://fleshtape.bandcamp.com/album/flesh-tape

8. Pedro the Lion - Santa Cruz. I always come back to David's Bazan's music. I fell off the wagon for a come albums (just not paying attention), but "Santa Cruz" really brought me back.   
Favorite track: Don't Cry Now  
Bandcamp: https://pedrothelion.bandcamp.com/album/santa-cruz

9. Love Letter - Every Wants Something Beautiful. Quinn Murphy's vocals have always had a soft spot in my heart, going back to the What Feeds the Fire / Verse days. It's nice to see them active on the mic. Music is melodic yet driving, and fiercely speaking truth to power.  
Favorite track: Misanthropic Holiday or Vacation  
Bandcamp: https://iodinerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/everyone-wants-something-beautiful

10. Sabrina Carpenter- Short n' Sweet. A bit of a guilty pleasure, but @amandakrstic got me hooked. Usually a pop album shows on these lists for me anyways. Not much to say, just catchy and great vocals. Also this lady has the horniest lyrics I've heard in pop in a while lol.  
Favorite track: Juno

## Honorable Mentions

11.  The Hope Conspiracy - Tools Of Oppression/Rule By Deception. Angry. Political. Heavy. Hardcore. A welcome return!
Favorite Track: "A Struggle for Power"  
Bandcamp: https://thehopeconspiracy.bandcamp.com/album/tools-of-oppression-rule-by-deception

12. @wearebrutus - Paradise. Only a single released this year, but dear lord what a single. I need to see this band live.
Bandcamp: https://wearebrutus.bandcamp.com/track/paradise
